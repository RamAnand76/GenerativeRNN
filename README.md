# NeuralNarrator: Advanced RNN-based Text Generation with Attention

## Description
NeuralNarrator is a sophisticated text generation model built using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) with attention mechanisms. This project leverages the power of GRU (Gated Recurrent Unit) layers and Additive Attention to create a versatile language model capable of generating coherent and context-aware text across various domains, including conversations, mathematical reasoning, physics, and more.

## Introduction
NeuralNarrator is designed to understand and generate human-like text based on input prompts. By utilizing advanced deep learning techniques, the model can capture complex patterns in language, making it suitable for a wide range of applications, from creative writing assistance to educational tools for explaining complex topics.

## Features
- RNN-based architecture with GRU layers for efficient sequence processing
- Attention mechanism for improved context understanding
- Versatile text generation across multiple domains (conversations, mathematics, physics, etc.)
- Customizable model parameters for fine-tuning performance
- Easy-to-use text generation interface
- Model saving and loading capabilities for convenient deployment

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RamAnand76/NeuralNarrator.git
cd NeuralNarrator
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To use NeuralNarrator for text generation:

```python
from neural_narrator import generate_text

seed_text = "if it rains"
generated_text = generate_text(seed_text, next_words=20, max_sequence_len=50)
print(generated_text)
```

## Model Architecture
NeuralNarrator employs a sophisticated architecture:
1. Input Layer
2. Embedding Layer (128-dimensional)
3. GRU Layer (256 units) with returned sequences
4. Additive Attention Layer
5. Flatten Layer
6. Dense Output Layer (softmax activation)

This architecture allows the model to capture long-term dependencies and focus on relevant parts of the input sequence during text generation.

## Training
The model is trained on a diverse dataset covering various topics. Key training parameters:
- Epochs: 30
- Batch Size: 64
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy

## Text Generation
Text generation is performed using a seed text and specifying the number of words to generate. The model uses a probabilistic approach to select the next word, ensuring varied and interesting outputs.

## Model Persistence
The trained model can be saved and loaded for future use:
- Full model save: `model.save("rnn_model_with_attention.h5")`
- Weights only: `model.save_weights("rnn.weights.h5")`

## Future Improvements
- Implement temperature scaling for controlling randomness in generation
- Explore transformer-based architectures for comparison
- Develop a web interface for easy interaction with the model
- Fine-tune on specific domains for specialized applications
